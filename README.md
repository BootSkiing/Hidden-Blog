# CJ's hidden Blog

An .onion blog using [Matt Traudt's Blog Maker](https://github.com/pastly/bm)

This blog is mostly an opportunity for me to learn more baout the Tor Project, server hardening, and contribute the the collection on mundain hidden services out there on the World Wide Web.

All posts are loacted in the [build directory](/build/p)

If you're interested in making your own blog, I encourage you to start fresh rather than forking this repo; it has some missing files. Blog Maker is really well documented! This repo is mostly just to show that I do something (mostly) productive with my free time.

It will be a casual blog; I'll try to stay consistent with posts.
