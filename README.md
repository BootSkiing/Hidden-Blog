# CJ's hidden Blog

An .onion blog using [Matt Traudt's Blog Maker](https://github.com/pastly/bm)

This blog is mostly an opportunity for me to learn more baout the Tor Project, server hardening, and contribute the the collection on mundain hidden services out there on the World Wide Web.

It will be a casual blog; I'll try to stay consistent with posts.
